# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, several models with unbalanced classes (good loans and risky loans) were trained and evaluated. The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate these models using the following resampling algorithms -

- RandomOverSampler (oversample)
- SMOTE (overample)
- ClusterCentroids (undersample)
- SMOTEEN (combinatorial)
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier (reduce bias)
- EasyEnsembleClassifier (reduce bias)

##Results

### RandomOverSampler (oversample)
- Balanced accuracy score
- Precision
- Recal score
### SMOTE (overample)

### ClusterCentroids (undersample)

### SMOTEEN (combinatorial)

### BalancedRandomForestClassifier (reduce bias)

### EasyEnsembleClassifier (reduce bias)


##Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
